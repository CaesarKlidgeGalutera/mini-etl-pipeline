# Mini ETL Pipeline with OpenWeather API and AWS S3

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and cloud technologies. The script fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it to extract key metrics, and uploads the results to an AWS S3 bucket in JSON format.

Itâ€™s designed to be deployable in a cloud function environment (e.g., AWS Lambda), showcasing key skills in API integration, cloud storage, and error handling.
